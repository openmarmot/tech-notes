Go Commands



-- module init --
# this creates go.mod file and is done in a folder where the module code will be 
# theoretically the path given should be internet reachable so it can be downloaded from
# in this case we run this in the 'greetings' folder and assume that example.com/greetings/filename*
# is a valid download path
# the go.mod file tracks the module dependencies. this file is maintained by go, not manually

go mod init example.com/greetings


# if you need a module to draw from local instead you can redirect it


-- update the mod file --
# adds the dependencies the code needs that are not yet in .mod file
go mod tidy



-- run your code --

# use this command in the folder with the .go file that has the main package
go run .


-- tests --
# ending a file name with *_test.go tells the go test command the file contains
# test functions

# -v for verbose
# run in a folder with *_test.go files
go test -v


-- compile and build --

# this should be run from the folder with the .go file that has the main package
go build

# this creates a executable file in the same directory which can be run with ./FILE

# if the go install dir is on your system path you can install the package so you can run it 
# anywhere by just using its name
go install

-- fix formatting issues --
gofmt -w /folder/main.go 

 -- useful notes --
 
 code executed as an application must be in a main package.
 
 # function naming
 function names with upper case - exported and used outside of the package
 function names with lower case - internal use only

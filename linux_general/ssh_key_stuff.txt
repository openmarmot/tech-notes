# -- setup --

#generate ssh key pair on your desktop as root. here are some options: 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (this one is probably the most compatbile)
ssh-keygen -t dsa 
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521  #this one is probably the most secure + compatible
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 #possibly most secure, limited compatibility

#this is saved in /home/andrew/.ssh/id_rsa

#you can copy the public key into the new machine's authorized_keys file with the
#ssh-copy-id command. Make sure to replace the example username and IP address below.

ssh-copy-id user@123.45.56.78i

#Alternatively, you can paste in the keys using SSH:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

#once you are logged in, disable password logins
# note - for fedora 39 and newer you will want to make a config file with your changes
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#look for the line below and change yes to no 
Password Authentication no

#restart sshd
#systemctl reload sshd

#if you have trouble, check the permissions, this is often the issue

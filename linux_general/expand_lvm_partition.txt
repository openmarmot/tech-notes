Expand a filesystem on LVM on a partition in Linux


# resize your EBS Volume in AWS via the user interface

# inspect the current block device situation
# you should see the size of the device and any partitions
# note which partition has LVM on it (possibly xvda2)
lsblk

# grow the partition that has LVM on it
# note the space between device name and partition number
# for xvda
growpart /dev/xvda 2
# for if the partition is nvme01p2
growpart /dev/nvme0n1 2

# verify that the partition is now larger with lsblk
lsblk

# check your LVM volume group config. Note Free PE/Size is still small
vgdisplay

# check current state of your physical volumes - note that it doesn't match the 
# new partition size. note the physical volume name 
pvs

# resize and recheck. It should now match the partition size
pvresize /dev/sda2 or pvresize /dev/xvda2
pvs
vgdisplay

# display logical volumes, noting the name and size of the one you want to resize
lvdisplay

# extend the volume you want to extend and recheck 
# here I am adding 20 Gigabytes to the home logical volume
lvextend -L +20G /dev/rootvg/home
lvdisplay

# determine file system type for the filesystem you want to expand
df -hT

# grow the filesystem on the volume you just extended
#for ext 
resize2fs /dev/rootvg/home

#for xfs
xfs_growfs /dev/rootvg/home

# confirm that the filesystem has been resized
df -h

Fedora Nvidia Drivers install with Secureboot 

1. Follow this process to install the Nvidia drivers
# note - follow it exactly. If you skip creating the key before installing the drivers 
# you will get an error about missing nvidia kernel on boot and it won't work

2. install CUDA local RPM from the NVIDIA site. They have a F41 specific download 
# note - i did not install the 'drivers' portion. I think what we did in step 1 
# covers this 

3. use locate to find NVCC - giving the location of the bin with the cuda tools. 
Then add it to your path 
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-12.8/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

4. you will probably want to install nvtop - which is a nice utility for seeing graphics card utilization

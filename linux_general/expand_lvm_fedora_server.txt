Expand LVM on Fedora Server 
last update : Oct 2024

For whatever reason Fedora server always just uses like 10% of the disk
by default with the auto partition setup.

# confirm that you have lvm  and note the associated mount point (probably /)
lsblk 

# confirm the logical volume name (probably /dev/fedora/root)
lvdisplay

# extend the logical volume 
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/fedora/root

# comfirm you are running XFS 
df -hT

# extend the XFS file system on the mount point 
xfs_growfs /

#use df to determine the drive naming format (IE : /dev/xvda, xvdb, etc
df -h

# search dev for available devices, making sure to use the appropriate name format
ls -l /dev/xvd*

# create a xfs filesystem on the new drive
mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdb

# make a directory for the new disk to mount to
mkdir /test

# add a line to fstab to auto mount it
/dev/xvdb /test xfs defaults 0 0

# re-mount all drives
mount -a

# check the new drive and mount point shows up
df -h

# reboot and double check
shutdown -r now

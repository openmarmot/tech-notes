Syntax reference:
- Single line comments start with #.
- Multi-line comments are wrapped with /* and */.
- Values are assigned with the syntax of key = value.
- Strings are in double-quotes.
- Strings can interpolate other values using syntax wrapped in ${}, for example ${var.foo}.
- Numbers are assumed to be base 10.
- Boolean values: true, false
- Lists of primitive types can be made with square brackets ([]), for example ["foo", "bar", "baz"].
- Maps can be made with braces ({}) and colons (:), for example { "foo": "bar", "bar": "baz" }.


------ Formatting -----

terraform fmt [options] [DIR]

-list=false - Don't list the files containing formatting inconsistencies.
-write=false - Don't overwrite the input files. (This is implied by -check or when the input is STDIN.)
-diff - Display diffs of formatting changes
-check - Check if the input is formatted. Exit status will be 0 if all input is properly formatted and non-zero otherwise.
-recursive - Also process files in subdirectories. By default, only the given directory (or current directory) is processed.

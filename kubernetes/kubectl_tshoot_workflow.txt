last update : Nov 30 2024

Some commands in the order that I found them useful. 

# troubleshooting an issue with a deployment with the namespace messageboard 

# 1. lets get everything in the namespace, and see what is up and what is not 
kubectl get all --namespace messageboard

# looks like a pod is down. lets describe to get more details 
kubectl describe pod messageboard-deployment-77cfd9f9db-jfcsg --namespace messageboard

# ok i think i fixed it. lets delete the pod so it is re-created 
kubectl delete pod messageboard-deployment-77cfd9f9db-jfcsg --namespace messageboard

virtio with 128 mb of ram seems to work well.
- seems better than spice. way less choppy
- multiple open at once seems fine
- low cpu 

client side
- needs a spice viewer
-- fedora : remote viewer from the app store
-- windows : virt viewer client : https://virt-manager.org/

once you have the spice viewer, click on the vm, it downloads a .vv file. open 
that and it jumps into the viewer

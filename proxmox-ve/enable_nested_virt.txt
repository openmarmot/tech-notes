SSH into the ProxMox VE Host

(These commands are for Intel)

# write out nested config
echo "options kvm-intel nested=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf

# remove module with old config
modprobe -r kvm-intel

# add module back in with new config
modprobe kvm-intel

# test - should return 'Y'
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested


The response to the last command should be “Y”. If it isn’t than either your CPU doesn’t support nested virtualization, or something else went wrong.

If you can I would recommend rebooting the host, just to double check that the setting took.


Hardware can be basically the same but cpu should be 'HOST'

mysql/mariadb change passwords

#if you aren't locked out 
ALTER USER 'user'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'newPass';

If you are locked out, try the two methods below: 

# -- method 1 --
# Stop Mysql service
service mysql stop
  
# Edit /etc/my.cnf and add the following option (under [mysqld] ) 
skip-grant-tables
skip-networking
  
# Start Mysql Service
service mysql start
  
# Login on Mysql Server as root user 
mysql -uroot
  
# Update the root password 
SET PASSWORD FOR root@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password');
  
# If that doesn't work you can update like so 
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('NEW-PASSWORD') WHERE User='root';
  
# if that doesn't work try this 
update user set authentication_string=password('1111') where user='root';  
Flush Privileges;
  
#remove the lines from my.cnf and restart


# -- method 2 (if the first one doesn't work) --
# Edit /var/lib/mysql/init-file.sql with the following content
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to root@localhost
IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
  
# Set the right permission
chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql/init-file.sql
      
# Restart mysql with init option on the created script  
service mysql restart --init-file=/var/lib/mysql/init-file.sql

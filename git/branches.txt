---- if you want to create the branch in the CLI -----

# list local and remote branches
git branch -a 

# create a new branch
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME

# git status should show you are on your new branch
git status

# on the first push set the up stream origin
git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME


---- if you created the branch already in the UI for github/lab/bucket ----

#  update your remote tracking branches
git fetch

# list all branches
git branch -a 


# checkout the one you want
git checkout BRANCH_NAME


--- if you want to pull the new changes from master back into your branch ---

# get into the branch, only if you aren't already
git checkout BRANCH_NAME

# pull and merge master
git pull origin master




----- deleting a branch --------------------

# see all remote branches
git branch -r

# delete a local branch 
git branch -d  local_branch_name

# delete a remote branch 
git push origin -d test



-------- merge a branch back into master ---------
git checkout master

git merge --squash BRANCH -m "super commit"

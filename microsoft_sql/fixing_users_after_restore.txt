When you restore a SQL Server database backup, the database users are restored
along with the database. However, the user information may not be automatically
associated with the restored database.

If you are seeing NULL in the LoginName column when listing users, it 
likely means that the user has not been mapped to a login. In SQL Server,
a login is a security principal that allows a user to connect to a SQL Server
instance. A user is then associated with a login to allow them access to 
a specific database.


# create a login 
CREATE LOGIN [LoginName] WITH PASSWORD = 'YourPassword';

# associate with existing user
USE [YourDatabaseName]
ALTER USER [UserName] WITH LOGIN = [LoginName];

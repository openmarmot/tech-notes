MarmotEdge SRX210 Config
This document goes through the setup I did on MarmotEdge
I used the following references
Day One: Configuring Junos Basics PDF
Juniper SRX Series O'Reilly Book
Set Root Password
# set system root-authentication plain-text-password
Set Hostname
#set system host-name marmotEdge
Setup Loopback Interface
//address has to be set as preferred because we also want to add the standard loopback ip
#set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 10.6.1.10/32 preferred
#set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 127.0.0.1
Management Interface
i'm not sure if this needs to be setup, or if we can just use the loopback address
Set Time
the date is in the form YYYYMMDDhhmm.ss
>set date 201404272009.00
//set timezone
#set system time-zone America/Phoenix
//verify settings
>show system uptime
>show ntp status
Set Login Banner
#set system login message "Unauthorized access is prohibited"
Create a Local User
#edit system login
#edit user andrew
#set authentication plain-text-password
#set class super-user
Enable Remote Access
#set system services ssh root-login deny
#set system services ssh protocol-version v2
#set system services ssh connection-limit 3
verify after commit
>show system services ssh
we will allow ssh on the LAN side interface in the next section.
Setup Security Zones
we need to setup security zone for the internet and LAN side of the networks. the zones can be
named anything, but we will go with the junos standard of untrust for internet side and trust for
LAN side.
//set the internet side untrust
#set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0
//make sure to show the int and delete any services that you don't want to allow through the
interface. the default has dhcp and tftp enabled
//set the LAN side trust
#set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0
//allow ssh, http and https web access, and ping on the "trust" security zone
#set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 host-inbound-traffic systemservices http
#set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 host-inbound-traffic systemservices https
#set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 host-inbound-traffic systemservices ping
#set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 host-inbound-traffic systemservices ssh
verify after commit
>show security zones
Setup IP interfaces
we want to set our internet facing interface with the static address given to us by the ISP, and
set our LAN facing interface with a /30 (two usable addresses) for connection with another
layer 3 device. Note that each interface needs to be setup as routing (INET)
#set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 24.255.102.178/28
#set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 10.6.2.1/30
verify after commit
>sh interfaces terse
Setup NAT
The Junos NAT type we will use is source NAT (many:1)
#set security nat source rule-set trust-untrust from zone trust
#set security nat source rule-set trust-untrust to zone untrust
#set security nat source rule-set trust-untrust rule outgoing match source-address 10.6.0.0/16
//set the source nat address to the be address of the egress interface
#set security nat source rule-set trust-untrust rule outgoing then source-nat interface
#set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy trust-outbound match sourceaddress any destination-address any application any
#set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy trust-outbound then permit
verify after commit
>sh security nat
>sh security policies
>sh security zones
>sh int terse
Setup Static Routes
setup a static route to our internet gateway
#set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 24.255.102.177
#set routing-options static route 192.168.0.0/16 next-hop 10.6.2.2
#set routing-options static route 10.6.0.0/16 next-hop 10.6.2.2
verify after commit (will not show up if the line is down)
[edit routing-options]
#show
Setup Web Interface
#set system services web-management http interface ge0/0/1
Misc
the srx210 starts with a bunch of dumb defaults.
make sure to delete/ turn off dhcp.
ge0/0/0 starts with allowing dhcp and tftp which should be turned off if not used

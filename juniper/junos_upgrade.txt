JUNOS OS Software Upgrade
http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos11.4/information-products/topic-collections/releasenotes/11.4/index.html?topic-63721.html
Connect to the network
plug a cable from an existing switch into the management interface (me0)
//configure the management interface with a IP address
#set interfaces me0 unit0 family inet address 192.168.12.20/24
//set the default route
#set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.12.1
you should now be able to ping the switch on the network assuming the switch it is connected to is setup with the
correct vlan on the port.
